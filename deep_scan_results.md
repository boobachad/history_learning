# Deep Scan Results

## Scan 1 - [2024-03-21]

### 1. Date Handling Inconsistencies
- Some places use `Date` objects, others use ISO strings
- Mix of `new Date()` and Luxon's `DateTime`
- Recommendation: Standardize on Luxon's `DateTime` throughout the codebase

### 2. Error Handling Patterns
- Inconsistent error handling across the codebase
- Some places use custom error types, others use generic errors
- Recommendation: Create a centralized error handling system with custom error types

### 3. Type Safety Issues
- Some API responses lack proper type definitions
- Inconsistent use of type assertions
- Recommendation: Add proper type definitions for all API responses

### 4. Code Organization
- Some utility functions are duplicated
- Inconsistent file structure
- Recommendation: Consolidate utility functions and standardize file structure

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Large batch processing without proper chunking
- Inefficient date parsing in some places
- Recommendation: Implement proper chunking and optimize date operations

### 6. Security Concerns
- Some API endpoints lack proper input validation
- Inconsistent error message exposure
- Recommendation: Add input validation and sanitize error messages

### 7. Testing Coverage
- Limited test coverage
- Missing unit tests for critical functions
- Recommendation: Add comprehensive test coverage

### 8. Documentation
- Inconsistent JSDoc comments
- Missing documentation for some functions
- Recommendation: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
